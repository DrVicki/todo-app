# Create HTML document for ToDo list application 

  - Open VS Code and open the folder you created during setting up your git repository earlier. 
  - Now create a new folder called ```public``` using the icon available in VS Codeâ€™s explorer.
    - The public folder will contain all our static content. 
      - Because we are just making a frontend now our HTML file will also go here.
